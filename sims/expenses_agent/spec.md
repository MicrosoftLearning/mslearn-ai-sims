This is a specification for a web app that supports employees with expense claims. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

The web page should include a chat pane in which the user can enter questions and see responses. The responses should be revealed as though they are being typed. The app should support the following questions and give the corresponding responses. For each supported question, include some logic to identity input that doesn't match exactly but means the same thing. For any other question, the app should respond with the message "I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question. Please try rewording it."
