This is a specification for an OCR app that reads receipts. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

When the app opens, it should import necessary modules to read text in an uploaded image. The library used must be lightweight and run in a browser using client-side JavaScript.

The app should display a button labeled "Upload receipt", which the user can click to upload an image (.jpg or .png). After the image is uploaded, the app should display it, and print the extracted text beneath it.
