This is a specification for a web app that supports a publishing business. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

The web page should include the following elements:

- An "Upload Image" button that displays a simulated "Open File" interface listing the files in the images folder. This should not be a real "Open file" dialog box, but it should look like the user is uploading a local file".
- When the user selects an image file, the page should display it.
- Under the displayed image, the page should show an AI-generated caption from the following values:
    - For image1.jpg: "A giraffe standing in the savannah"
    - For image2.jpg: "An elephant with large tusks"
    - For image3.jpg: "A lion in long grass"
