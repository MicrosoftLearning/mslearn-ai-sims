This is a specification for a web app that supports an expenses application. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

The web page should include an "Upload Receipt" button that displays a simulated "Open File" interface listing the files in the receipts folder. This should not be a real "Open file" dialog box, but it should look like the user is uploading a local file".

When the user uploads a file, display the receipt image on the left. On the right, display the message "Analyzing receipt..." for three seconds. Then, replace the image with the equivalent one from the results folder and replace the "Analyzing receipt..." text with the following details for the selected receipt file:
