This is a specification for an image analysis app. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

When the app opens, it should import Tensorflow.js and the MobileNet model

The app should allow users to upload an image and click "Analyze", at which point the Mobilenet model should be used to classify the image and display what it contains.
