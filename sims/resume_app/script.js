Dear ${selectedResume.name},

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding an exciting ${job.title} opportunity at ${job.company} that aligns well with your background as a ${selectedResume.title}.

    üìÑ "${job.description}"

Based on your resume, I can see you have strong experience in ${matchedSkills.join(', ')}, which are key requirements for this role. Your ${selectedResume.experience} years of experience would be valuable to their team.

To strengthen your application for this position, I recommend highlighting your experience with ${matchedSkills.slice(0, 2).join(' and ')} in your cover letter.${missingSkills.length > 0 ? ` Additionally, consider gaining some exposure to ${missingSkills.join(', ')} as these are also important for the role.` : ''}

Would you be interested in learning more about this opportunity? I'd be happy to schedule a brief call to discuss the role in detail and answer any questions you might have.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Contact Information]

P.S. Based on my analysis, you have a ${currentComparison.overallMatch}% compatibility with this role - a ${currentComparison.overallMatch >= 70 ? 'strong' : currentComparison.overallMatch >= 50 ? 'moderate' : 'developing'} match that shows great potential.`;
